# Checkers

We want to simulate the checkers game.

We have an 8x8 matrix that represents the playing surface.

Given the position of a checker on the playing surface, we want to calculate new positions it can reach.

The received arguments are:

`x - the line on which the piece whose position we want to calculate is located'

`y - the column on which the piece whose position we want to calculate is located'

`boards - the game board where the positions where the game piece can reach will be placed'



There will be no collisions between game pieces. We assume that there is only one piece on the game board.

Pieces cannot leave the playing surface.
